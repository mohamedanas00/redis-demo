# MongoDB and Redis Caching in User Management System

## Overview
 - This document explores the implementation of a user management system using MongoDB for persistent storage and Redis for efficient caching, highlighting the synergy between database and caching technologies.

## Core Components
 - MongoDB: Primary data storage
 - Redis: In-memory caching layer
 - Express.js: Web application framework


## Caching Strategy 

  Primary Objectives: 
  -  Reduce database load
  -  Improve response times
  -  Enhance application performance
  -  Minimize latency in data retrieval

  Caching Workflow:
  1. User Creation Process
    * Store data in MongoDB
    * Simultaneously cache in Redis
    * Use email as unique identifier

  2. Data Retrieval Mechanism
    * Check Redis cache first
    * Fetch from MongoDB if cache miss
    * Update cache with database results
