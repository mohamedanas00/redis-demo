# Demo: User Management System with MongoDB and Redis Caching

## Overview

- This document explores the implementation of a user management system using MongoDB for persistent storage and Redis for efficient caching, highlighting the synergy between database and caching technologies.

## Core Components

- MongoDB: Primary data storage
- Redis: In-memory caching layer
- Express.js: Web application framework

## Caching Strategy

Primary Objectives:

- Reduce database load
- Improve response times
- Enhance application performance
- Minimize latency in data retrieval

Caching Workflow:

1. User Creation Process

   - Store data in MongoDB
   - Simultaneously cache in Redis
   - Use email as unique identifier

2. Data Retrieval Mechanism
   - Check Redis cache first
   - Fetch from MongoDB if cache miss
   - Update cache with database results

## Performance Benefits

Advantages
  -  âš¡ Faster data access
  -  ðŸ’¾ Reduced database query overhead
  -  ðŸš€ Improved application scalability
  -  ðŸ“Š More efficient resource utilization

## Caching Patterns
Read-Through Caching

 - Check cache initially
 - Retrieve from database if not cached
 - Populate cache with retrieved data

Write-Through Caching
 - Simultaneous database and cache updates
 - Ensures data consistency
 - Maintains real-time data synchronization
